# FOLIO | The Literary Index

> *"A digital index for the wandering reader."*

**FOLIO** is a minimalist book recommendation engine designed to feel less like a search bar and more like a conversation with a well-read librarian. It doesn't prioritize bestseller lists or generic algorithms it prioritizes how a book *feels*.

In an era of infinite scrolling and overwhelmed decision-making, FOLIO offers a quiet corner of the internet where you can consult **The Archivist** by describing a plot, a specific feeling, a vague memory, or a fleeting thought.

## The Concept

Most book sites ask you for a title or a genre. FOLIO asks for your state of mind.

The interface is built to mimic the tactile experience of physical stationery. From the "ink bleed" typography to the paper grain noise textures, every interaction is designed to slow you down just enough to appreciate the recommendation.

Whether you're looking for *"space horror with a lonely protagonist"* or *"a novel that feels like a rainy Tuesday in London,"* the system understands the abstract and delivers the concrete.

## How It Works

**1. The Consultation**
You type your query into the entry slip. It can be as precise as a plot summary or as abstract as a single emotion.

**2. The Archivist (Gemini 2.0)**
Your request is processed by Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model, acting as a literary expert. It parses the nuance of your request to select the single best book match, providing a short, evocative reason for the choice.

**3. The Clerk (Google Books API)**
Once the book is selected, the system instantly consults the Google Books catalogue to fetch the official cover art, user ratings, and vote counts, presenting it all on a clean index card.

## Features

* **Vibe-Based Intelligence:** Moves beyond keywords to understand the *mood* of your request.
* **Neomorphic Design:** A "soft" UI that feels like paper and ink, with smooth, spring-like animations.
* **Native App Feel:** Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA). You can install it on your phone, complete with touch gestures—swipe back to close a card, just like a native app.
* **Privacy-First:** No login required. No tracking. Just you and the books.

## Built With

* **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** (The Brains)
* **Google Books API** (The Library)
* **Vercel Serverless Functions** (The Security)
